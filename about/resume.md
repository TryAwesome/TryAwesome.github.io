## Education
### Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University — B.S. in Information and Computing Science (Expected 2028)
- GPA: 3.96/4.0

## Research and Projects
### EmoSound — Multimodal Agentic System for Emotion-Aware Emoji-to-Audio Retrieval (Co-author) (Jul 2025 – Aug 2025)
- Designed and built an end-to-end **agentic multimodal pipeline** that converts emoticon images into emotionally aligned audio, structuring the workflow into perception, semantic reasoning, retrieval, and decision stages.
- Implemented **agent orchestration in n8n**, coordinating VLM-based captioning, fine-tuned CLIP emotion classification, LLM-based semantic fusion, Top-K retrieval, and LLM re-ranking for adaptive (non-rule-based) decision making.
- Enabled reliable downstream retrieval by supporting a fine-tuned CLIP backbone achieving **82.44% Top-1** emotion recognition accuracy (vs **21.53%** Vanilla CLIP baseline).
- Validated real-world usefulness via a human study (**N=10**): the full agent workflow improved **expressiveness (+1.60)** and **usability (+0.90)** over a text-only baseline.

### Pareto-Guided Optimization for Uncertainty-Aware Medical Image Segmentation (CVPR, under review) (2025 – present)
- Formulated uncertainty-aware medical segmentation as a **Pareto-consistent optimization** problem, explicitly modeling heterogeneous uncertainty between interior and boundary regions to stabilize early-stage training.
- Led the integration and evaluation on **mmFormer** (multimodal Transformer for brain tumor segmentation), embedding **intuitionistic fuzzy labels** and adaptive Pareto parameters into the fused branch to resolve boundary–interior optimization conflicts.
- Achieved consistent segmentation improvements on **BraTS18** and **Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks**, with gains up to **+3.3 Dice**, especially under **missing- and single-modality** settings where multimodal models are most unstable.
- Demonstrated smoother convergence and reduced gradient oscillation, improving both training stability and robustness in high-uncertainty clinical scenarios.
